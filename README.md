# Regression

This is a very basic problem of machine learning and probably the simplest one to implement with code and understand as well.
Machine learning models are all about deriving the relationship between the data we provide and the output it produces. This 
is the beauty of AI we provide data and it's respective output using those machine develop the rules or relation all by itself.<br><br>
Coming back to the topic in our daily life we came across of a  lot of complex problems but luckily some of them are can be 
solved easily like the one shown below. We have two labels one is years of experience and the salary which would be given to 
them once they join the company. The best part is that our Mr. boss considers the only experience as a valuable parameter which
would decide their salary and we wouldn't give him any ideas to consider other parameters like skills, projects developed and etc
to avoid getting our simple problem fall in the complex one.<br><br>
So the math is simple experience is directly proportional to the salary they are going to receive higher the experience higher the
salary they will receive. We are going to build this model using the equation y = w*x+b where x is the input to our single neuron
and y is the output it would produce. That's the only thing we are going to require we don't need any activation function in this case.<br><br><br>
